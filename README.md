# My Portfolio

Here are some of the specifics about my portfolio React app:

* Home page: mlango (the entrance)
* About page: shares my current practices and goals in coding.
* Portfolio page: showcases some of my latest works.
* Contact page: displays a contact form where you can get in touch with me. The code for this page is hidden to protect the Emailjs keys and my email address.

When you type in your information & message in the contact form and submit it, this is what I will see in my Gmail inbox:

From:
<img src='assets\images\contact-form-example.jpg' alt='Screenshot of a Contact Form Example' width='400'>

To:
<img src='assets\images\emailjs-contact-info-recvd.jpg' alt='Screenshot of a Email Received' width='400'>

## Technologies Used

* React
* Email.js
* React Router Dom
* React Bootstrap & Bootstrap
* React-spring
* Style-components

## Learning Points

 It took me a few months to code this app because my initial desire was to include an email API in the backend. Unfortunately, I could not get the email API to function because the API keys I used from NodeMailer and SendGrid were nonfunctioning. Therefore, I resorted to an email service for the frontend. 
 
## Plans

 Eventually, I will return to this app to include an email API in the backend.

 I also will change the layout to an SPA.
