# My Portfolio

https://tanisha-howell.herokuapp.com/

Here are some of the specifics about my React portfolio app:

* Home page: entrance.
* About page: shares my current practices and goals in coding.
* Portfolio page: showcases some of my latest works.
* Contact page: displays a contact form where you can get in touch with me, find the link to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages.

When you type in your information & message in the contact form and submit it, this is what I will see in my Gmail inbox:

<img src="/src/assets/images/emailjs-contact-info-recvd.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Email Received" width="400">

## Technologies Used

* React
* Email.js
* React Router Dom
* React Bootstrap & Bootstrap
* React-spring
* Style-components

## Learning Points

It took me a few months to code this app because my initial desire was to include an email API in the backend. Unfortunately, I could not get the email API to function because the API keys I used from NodeMailer and SendGrid were nonfunctioning. Therefore, I resorted to an email service for the frontend. 
 
## Plans

- [ ] Eventually, I will return to this app to include an email API in the backend.

- [ ] I also will change the layout to an SPA.
